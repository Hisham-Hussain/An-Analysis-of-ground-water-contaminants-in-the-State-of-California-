# An Analysis of ground water contaminants in the State of California 
## Overview of the project

The aim of the project was to analyse and visualise the number of contaminant leaks across the state  of California with the aim of determining which county succumbed to the most leaks and to understand what contaminants constituted those leaks. 

## Dataset
The dataset used was obtained from the California state government and it is a record of an instance of a leak from companies within the state. The data contains information of the company that has reported a leak, the county and city in which they are based as well as their coordinates. Descriptions of the date of when where and how the leak were doumented as well as the actions performed to stop the leak, including the date the leak case was considered to be closed.

Furthermore, the constituents of the leak were specified as well as the the amount in gallons and what media (soil,water,etc) was to be potentially affected by the leak.

The source and cause of the leaks were also included but neally half the entires did not have those facts disclosed.

## Analysis 
 - How long it took for a leak to be reported
 - How long it took for the leak to be repaired
 - Which company had the most leaks
 - Companies that didnt disclose the constituents of the leak
 - Difference in the Cal3 and Cal4 score and wthey might signify
 - Ratio of disadvantaged to severly disdvantaged
 - What were the most common contaminants
 - What was the average amount in gallons of leaks in every county 
## Dependencies
